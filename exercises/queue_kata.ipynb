    "\n",
    "- it is not possible to call async functions directly from non-async code. doing something like `hello_world()` with an async function will simply have no effect - the async code will only run with `await` or `asyncio.run` etc.\n",
    "- async functions do NOT switch execution to another unless `await` is used.\n",
    "  - this is in contrast to `threading`, where this switching happens at random points that you have no control over\n",
    "  - this is the pivotal, main distinction between `async` and `threads`\n",
    "- if you need to switch control to another async function without actually doing anything, you can use `await asyncio.sleep(0)`\n",
    "- print debugging/logging is your friend when writing async code. As the number of async tasks grows, so does the complexity of their interactions, and it's not always possible to use unit testing alone in order to ensure expected behaviour and avoid deadlocks"
